Description
===
This is a GUI application that allows for construction and simulation of circuits using simple mouse and keyboard controls. The premise is that there is a grid of points, where wires can connect. The columns on these grids can be toggled to be parallel-- such as in a breadboard. Upon each grid 'node', a gate can be placed. Sub-Circuits will be supported eventually.

- Generate a grid of 'nodes'

- Simulate electric charge going through the circuit
- Connect nodes on a column.
- Sub-circuits
- Cross-Platform, including Web
- Export to picture and video
