Description
===
This is a GUI application that allows for construction and simulation of
circuits using simple mouse and keyboard controls. The premise is that there is
a grid of points, where wires can connect. Upon each grid 'node', a gate
can be placed. Sub-Circuits will be supported eventually.

Wanted Features
---
- [X] Generate a grid of 'nodes'
- [ ] GUI controls, as well as keyboard where it makes sense.
- [X] Panning and Zooming on 'board'
- [X] Toolbox for simple gates.
- [X] Rotation of simple gates.
- [X] Simulate electric charge going through the circuit
- [ ] Sub-circuits
- [ ] Cross-Platform, including Web
- [ ] Export to picture, video, and code
- [ ] Wires that can go 'underneath' other wires
