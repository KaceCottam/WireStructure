title Roadmap

state V1 as "V1.0 Drawable Circuits"
V1 : Drawing of circuit diagrams, with some basic gates, multiplexers.
V1 : The goal at this point is to be able to draw a MIPS architecture diagram, like as presented in the picture below.

state V11 as "V1.1 Variable Inputs"
V11 : Variable-input gates for ""AND"", ""OR"", ""NAND"", ""XOR"", ""XNOR"", ""MULTIPLEXER"", etc.

state V12 as "V1.2 Logic Circuits"
V12 : Adding on to drawing: We can now simulate basic on and off functionality through wires.
V12 : We should be able to color wires based on their state (if wanted) and we should be able to generate input sequences through manual activation.
V12 : The goal at this point is to simulate basic logic circuits that use single-bit wires.

state V13 as "V1.3 Input Modeling"
V13 : Generate input sequences using function-based activation (such as a waveform).

state V14 as "V1.4 Boolean Algebra Rendering"
V14 : See resulting boolean algebra at the output.
V14 : Insert a sequence of gates using boolean algebra.

state V15 as "V1.5 Computer Architecture"
V15 : We should be able to make wires with multiple bits, and split those wires.
V15 : The goal at this point is to fully simulate a MIPS architecture diagram.

state V2 as "V2.0 More than Logic"
V2 : We should be able to add other circuit components based in physics, as well as measure voltage, current, etc.
