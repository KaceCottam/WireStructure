Description
===
This is a GUI application that allows for construction of circuits using simple
mouse and keyboard controls. The premise is that there is a grid of points, where
wires can connect. The columns on these grids can be toggled to be parallel--
such as in a breadboard. Upon each grid 'node', a gate can be placed. Sub-Circuits
will be supported eventually.

Wanted Features
---
- Generate a grid of 'nodes'
- GUI controls, as well as keyboard where it makes sense.
- Panning and Zooming on 'board'
- Toolbox for simple gates.
- Simulate electric charge going through the circuit
- Connect nodes on a column.
- Sub-circuits
- Cross-Platform, including Web
- Export to picture and video

Dependencies

- WxWidgets
- Nim
