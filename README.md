Description
===
This is a GUI application that allows for construction and simulation of circuits using simple mouse and keyboard controls. The premise is that there is a grid of points, where wires can connect. The columns on these grids can be toggled to be parallel-- such as in a breadboard. Upon each grid 'node', a gate can be placed. Sub-Circuits will be supported eventually.

Wanted Features
---
- Generate a grid of 'nodes'
- GUI controls, as well as keyboard where it makes sense.
- Panning and Zooming on 'board'
- Toolbox for simple gates.
- Simulate electric charge going through the circuit
- Connect nodes on a column.
- Sub-circuits
- Cross-Platform, including Web
- Export to picture and video

Technologies
===
- C++
- SFML

I am using `C++` and `SFML`.  WxWidgets for graphics is simple, and I am tutoring in C++. Since this is a teaching tool, it makes sense that I am going to show the code for making this to my tutees as well.
